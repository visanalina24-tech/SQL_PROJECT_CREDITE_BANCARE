I will demonstrate in this project the lending activity of a bank, highlighting the economic relationships between customers, employees, accounts, loans and installments.

My Bank offers loans to its customers, each identified by personal data and monthly income. Each registered customer has a unique identification code in the bank's database, in order to be easier to track and observe the history of payments, receipts or any other type of financial transaction. A customer can hold one or more bank accounts, these being identified by the unique IBAN code, given by the bank, and the customer's unique registration code.

The bank employee, in the position of "Functionar Bancar" (“Bank Clerk”), is responsible for opening a loan, at the client’s request, and for ensuring that all the data entered is correct and accurate. The loan can be of 4 types: personal needs, real estate, leasing and investment. Each loan contains information regarding the amount borrowed, the date of granting, duration and status, and is based on a unique ID automatically generated by the bank.

Loan repayment is carried out through due installments, and any delays are highlighted by arrears, which indicate the risk of non-payment and the impact on the bank's financial stability. 

In conclusion, the database helps the bank track:
- customers and their financial situation,
- loans granted,
- payments and arrears,
- employee activity.
  
Indexes used:
- PK_ANGAJAT_ANGAJAT_ID
- PK_CLIENTI
- PK_CREDITE CREDIT_ID
- PK_FUNCTIE_FUNCTIE_ID
- PK_RATE_RATA_ID
- PK_RESTANTE_RESTANTA_ID
- PK_TIPURI_DE_CREDIT_TIP_CREDIT_ID
- UQ_CLIENTI_CNP
- UQ_CONTURI_IBAN

Within this project, I created several tables entitled: CLIENTI, ANGAJATI, FUNCTIE, CONTURI, CREDITE, TIPURI DE CREDITE, RATE, RESTANTE. (Translated: CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, POSITION, ACCOUNTS, LOANS, TYPES OF LOANS, INSTALLMENTS, FINANCIAL RATIOS)

NOTES:
- This project was created with Apex ORACLE, using SQL and PL/SQL.
- This project was created in Romanian and I have no problem working with English terms.
